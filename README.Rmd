# jsvm

jsvm is my personal toolbelt package with functions that I often tend to use or had fun making for some specific purpose.


## Exported functions

* `whoami()`: get filename of executing script when run with Rscript
* `expr2tikz()`: plot the AST of an expression with TikZ (tikz-qtree) in the style of the figures in [Advanced R: Expressions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html)
